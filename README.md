**ODT-MPA starter theme** - is starter theme is demonstared a typical out-of-the-box B2B Portal that beign a part of the [Digital Organic Transformation (ODT)]() strategy and built using Liquid templates, Vue.JS web progressive framework and Bootstrap CSS with elements of Web CMS.
 This theme represents the VC Team's opinionated starting point for new projects. It strives to include up-to-date best practices and solutions that we have deemed needed for the majority of projects we build. It is a reflection of what’s possible when building a theme! 

The **ODT-MPA starter theme** is not only a real-world solution that implements practical business use-cases and  this is also the good starting point for your theme that you can customize by direct code modifications!

# The project non-functional key features:

- Plays opinionated starting point for all new themes and frontend solution constructed on VC storefront. 
- Focus on development performance thanks to maximum reusing of exciting developer experience such as server side functionality, web components and views.
- SEO friendly thanks to SSR (Server Side Rendering) performing on the VC Storefront ASP.NET Core application.
- Presentation logic decoupling from backend. You might fully concentrate on  presentation tasks and do not think for backend. 
- Intentionaly lack of using custom CSS an initial styles constructed, using popular Bootstrap CSS library  and have an adaptive markup allows working on all popular devices and resolutions to make the customization process for theme styles  more straitforward. 
- Support WEB content management experience without development labor thanks to integration with [VC page  builder](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-pagebuilder)
- Liquid templates and SSR (server side rendering)  + MPA (mutiple page application) architecture with using Vue.JS progressive framework allow to get the all benefits from both server side and WEB development technices.

# How does it work?
TBD
# Why MPA (Multi Page Application) instead of SPA (Single Page Application)?
There are the folowing  reasones why MPA architecture has been chosen. 
- SEO requirements. One of the weaknesses of the SPA is SEO. Unfortunately, they aren’t as SEO friendly as MPA’s. It’s primarily because the majority of single-page applications are run on JavaScript, which most search engines do not support. MPA enables better website positioning as each page can be optimized for a different keyword. Also, meta tags can be included on every page – this positively impacts Google rankings.
- Web CMS integration. VC team have been working on own Web CMS implementation [VC page  builder](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-pagebuilder), this tools allows to edit Liquid themes files and theme settings using a visual editor along with using the storefront for preview of changes. 
- Reusing of exists Storefront's functionality such as security, slug routing, multiple stores, currencies, and languages. All these functionalities are hard to be reused in the classical SPA applications.
